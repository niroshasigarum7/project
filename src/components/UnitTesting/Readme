Jest - Unit testing

1. Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
2. It works with projects using Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more!


Advantages
1. zero config: Jest aims to work out of the box, config free, on most JavaScript projects.
2. snapshots: Make tests which keep track of large objects with ease. Snapshots live either alongside your tests or embedded inline.
3. isolated: Tests are parallelized by running them in their own processes to maximize performance.
4. great api: From it to expect - Jest has the entire toolkit in one place. Well documented, well maintained, well good
5. Fast and safe
- By ensuring your tests have unique global state, Jest can reliably run tests in parallel.
- To make things quick, Jest runs previously failed tests frist and re-organizes runs based on how long test files take.
6. Code coverage
- Generate code coverage by adding the flag --coverage.
- No additional setup needed.
- Jest can collect code coverage information from entire projects, including untested files.
7. Easy mocking
- Jest uses a custom resolver for imports in your tests making it simple to mock any object outside of your test's scope.
- You can use mocked imports with the rich Mock functions API to spy on function calls with readable test syntax
8. great exceptions
- Test fail - when they do, Jest provides rich context (toBe, toBeCloseTo toEqual)
